# ComplaintManagementSystem
Web application that allows user to to post their complaints related to public service departments like Police, Fire etc. 
These Complaints will be posted as tweets from a common portal to twitter wherein other people facing the same problem can either comment/re-tweet or like/favorite the tweet. 
These tweets/complaints will be extracted from the account on twitter on a predefined time interval and posted to the respective department dashboard sorted/prioritized based on the highest number of re-tweets or likes. 
In this way, we will prioritize the most common complaint/problem faced by people and ensure that the most important or most common issues are resolved faster. 
On resolution of the issue/complaint by the respective department, the user will be notified about the same.
